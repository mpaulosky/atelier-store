# Tests for .github/hooks/pre-push.
# Each case runs the hook in a throwaway repo, holding a copy of
# scripts/gate.sh, with the refs git would pass on stdin. Stub `dotnet`, `npm`,
# `npx` and `yamllint` binaries log each call, and fail when the call matches
# the FAIL glob, so no real build or network access is needed.
# Usage: .github/hooks/tests/pre-push.test.sh
